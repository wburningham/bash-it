##bash-it

This is my personal version of the [bash it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it) commands and scripts. The biggest change is the smaller colors file so a new prompt loads faster.

This has only been tested on OSX 10.7.

##installation
Link the bash profile to your user directory:

	cd ~
	git clone git://github.com/wburningham/bash-it.git .bash-it
	ln -s ~/.bash-it/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
